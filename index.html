                        I chose to redesign the website visualized below, which offers information about worldwide train trips. 
                        As someone who loves traveling, I appreciate websites that offer thorough information about transportations 
                        in different countries, 
                        but the website I found was too complicated to navigate through despite offering valuable information,
                        which is why I chose to redesign it. You can find the link to the original website here: <a href = "https://www.seat61.com/index.html">https://www.seat61.com/index.html</a>

                   </div>
                    <h3 style="font-size:1.5rem">
                        Before designing a new version of the original website, I identified problems the website had in terms of learnability, 
                        memorability, usability, 
                        users' mental model of the website, and accessibility. Here are my findings.
                    </h3>

                    <h3 style="font-size:1.5rem">This page is not learnable, because... </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The contents in the "Train travel in the UK, Europe, and Worldwide" section 
                            compose a subset of contents in the long window on the left-hand side of the page.</li>
                        <li>It’s unclear what types of train travels classify as “Great train journeys” 
                            and how the information this section conveys differs from the ones that other sections already cover.</li>
                        <li>Tabs like “Buy ferry tickets” and “Book a hotel” in the navbar are misleading, 
                            because they lead to pages that show recommendations about 
                            websites where people can book ferry tickets or hotels, 
                            instead of allowing them to book them without leaving this website.</li>   
                        <li>Although there are multiple dropdown menus, 
                            users can only manipulate one menu at a time, 
                            because changing values in one of the dropdown menus takes the user to another page, 
                            without giving a chance for users to enter values in more than one dropdown menu or modify values they entered.</li>
                    </ul>
               
                    <h3 style="font-size:1.5rem">This page is not memorable, because... </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users may not be able to remember that if they want to find information 
                            about traveling by train in Asia specifically, 
                            they need to scroll down the page and 
                            find a section titled “Train travel in Asia” in the narrow column on the left-hand side</li>
                        <li>Users may not remember which dropdown menu to select in the "Train travel in the UK, Europe, and Worldwide" section
                            if they want to search for trains leaving from a specific city, 
                            because some dropdown menus show country names, while others show city names.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 style="font-size:1.5rem">This page is not usable, because... </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If users want to find trains that travel from one city to another,
                             they cannot select both departure and arrival cities on the same page.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 style="font-size:1.5rem">This page doesn't match users' conceptual model, because... </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users cannot specify arrival and departure countries or cities.</li>
                        <li>Users cannot enter dates during which they will be traveling</li>
                        <li>Users may have the illusion that all countries listed under “Train travel worldwide” 
                            would be reachable solely by train, 
                            because upon opening the dropdown menu, 
                            they are asked to choose a country they want to search “train travel to, in, or from”. 
                            However, that is not true for some countries like Japan, which is an island country 
                            that is not connected to any other countries via underwater tunnels.</li>
                    </ul>
               
                    <h3 style="font-size:1.5rem">This page may not be accessible, because... </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>WebAIM WAVE pointed out low contrasts in the navbar and the middle window of the page. 
                            I agree with this problem, because the white text that the website used 
                            on the light gray navbar and the bright picture in the middle window doesn’t stand out, 
                            which may be problematic to visually imparied people.</li>
                        <li>WebAIM WAVE also pointed out redundant links for train travels in Azerbaijan and Armenia, 
                            which are in the left column. I agree with this problem too, 
                            because since clicking “Azerbaijan” and “Armenia” 
                            both lead to the same page titled “How to travel by train in Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan”. 
                            It’s better to group these three countries into one menu item.</li>
